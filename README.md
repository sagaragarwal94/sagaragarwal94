Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sagar. I've been using GitHub to host my repos and contribute to the open source community for many years.

I've been focused on backend, frontend, iOS and Android development. I'm passionate about people, startups, computers and many other things.

I also mentor junior developers and have invested a good amount of time helping them build their skill set in different technologies. I'm always proud to play the mentoring role because that's how I can give back what I was taught in the past. Seeing people succeeding in the development world is awesome!

In my GitHub professional profile, you'll find many open source projects that I contribute to as well as my studying side projects where I work hard to become a better technologist.
